					<p> We are a group of individuals and our common field is interest in things and principles at lower level. We like to disassemble and build things and we think that this is the best way how to learn something while having fun doing so. This website is something like common notes/diary and also this is our common space, where we want to publish short info about things which we are interested in.

	We are not an official organization and we have no leader. Our website lives at free github hosting and all informations are built by git commits to our main repository. Please have a look into our <a href="">"RULES"</a> section. If you want to publish on rusty pipe, you are more than welcome!

<p> ...we are rusting pipes since 17.5.2018.</p>
